        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Edward and I have experience in the Software Testing Industry, I've done both manual and automation testing.
          I’ve worked primarily in an Agile scrum environment and I've worked on different applications. I've designed, developed and help
          enhance and maintain different frameworks most recent one being a hybrid utilizing different sets of tools such as Maven, Selenium, Java,
          Cucumber, Git along with GitHub,Jenkins, Jira. I've also used Postman for API Testing with Rest Assured Library, TestNG and SQL.
          Aside from my technical background I've always had a curious mind. I always wanted to know how things worked which is why I like to problem solve and break things down; which helped me
          become detail oriented. I always have a positive outlook on life no matter what and I adapt to different circumstances and situations. I learn and grow from it.
          I like to communicate and collaborate with people and help anyone in need. All of this has helped me excel in not only in my career but in life.</p>
